At Resume-Resum, we take the security of our users' data seriously. This document outlines our security practices and measures to protect user information and ensure a safe browsing experience. 

## User Data Protection

### Data Encryption

- Regular code reviews and security assessments are conducted to identify and mitigate potential security risks.

## Monitoring and Incident Response

- In the event of a security breach, we will notify affected users and take appropriate measures to mitigate the impact.
